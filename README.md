# Versioning
We are using `Feature Branch + Merge Requests` git workflow which means that feature branches will be used for each new functionality and that it needs a merge request that will be reviewed for it to be pushed into `master`.

[Karma's git commit message convention](https://karma-runner.github.io/4.0/dev/git-commit-msg.html) is what we use to name our commits.
